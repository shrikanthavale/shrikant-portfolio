When I built the automated grading system for my Master's thesis, one of the core engineering challenges was this: how do you control virtual machines programmatically from a web application?

Oracle VirtualBox has a desktop GUI for managing VMs. But we needed something a Moodle PHP plugin could call over HTTP — not a desktop application. The solution was to wrap the VirtualBox SDK in a REST API, giving any application full lifecycle control over VMs through simple HTTP calls.

This post covers how that REST API was designed and built.

## Why a REST API

The system architecture had four layers, with the Moodle plugin at the top and VirtualBox at the bottom. The plugin is PHP. VirtualBox is controlled via a Java SDK. These two cannot communicate directly.

A REST API in the middle solves this cleanly:

```
Moodle Plugin (PHP)
    ↓ HTTP calls
REST API (Java/Tomcat)
    ↓ VirtualBox SDK (vboxjws.jar)
Oracle VirtualBox
    ↓ runs
Virtual Machines (SliTaz Linux)
```

The REST API becomes a language-agnostic interface. Any client — PHP, Python, mobile app — can control VMs without knowing anything about the VirtualBox SDK. This is the same pattern used by cloud providers like AWS EC2, which expose VM management through HTTP APIs regardless of the underlying hypervisor.

## The VirtualBox SDK

Oracle VirtualBox ships with `vboxjws.jar` — a Java library that exposes the full VirtualBox API. Before the REST API can use it, VirtualBox must be running with its web service enabled:

```bash
# Start VBoxWebSrv on the machine where VirtualBox is installed
vboxwebsrv --host 0.0.0.0 --port 18083
```

This starts a SOAP web service that the SDK connects to. From Java:

```java
VirtualBoxManager manager = VirtualBoxManager.createInstance(null);
manager.connect("http://192.168.1.100:18083", "", "");
IVirtualBox vbox = manager.getVBox();
```

Once connected, `vbox` gives you access to all VMs installed on that VirtualBox instance.

## Core API Endpoints

The REST API exposes two groups of operations — VM management and code execution.

### VM Management

**List all virtual machines:**

```
GET /vm/list
```

Returns name, state (running/stopped), OS type for each VM.

**Get VM details:**

```
GET /vm/{name}
```

Returns IP address (if running), state, OS name, memory.

**Start a VM:**

```
POST /vm/{name}/start
```

Internally:

```java
IMachine machine = vbox.findMachine(name);
ISession session = manager.getSessionObject();
IProgress progress = machine.launchVMProcess(
    session, "headless", null
);
progress.waitForCompletion(30000); // wait up to 30 seconds
```

The `headless` parameter means no GUI — the VM boots but shows no desktop. Critical for server environments.

**Stop a VM:**

```
POST /vm/{name}/stop
```

```java
IMachine machine = vbox.findMachine(name);
ISession session = manager.getSessionObject();
machine.lockMachine(session, LockType.Shared);
IConsole console = session.getConsole();
console.powerDown();
```

**Clone a VM:**

```
POST /vm/clone
Body: { "sourceName": "base-vm", "cloneName": "student-42" }
```

This is the most important operation. Every student gets a clone of the base VM:

```java
IMachine source = vbox.findMachine(sourceName);
IMachine clone = vbox.createMachine(
    null, cloneName, null, "Linux", null
);
IProgress progress = source.cloneTo(
    clone,
    CloneMode.MachineState,
    null
);
progress.waitForCompletion(120000); // cloning takes time
clone.saveSettings();
vbox.registerMachine(clone);
```

The clone is a full copy of the base VM — same OS, same tools, same utility application. It boots independently and can be destroyed without affecting the original.

**Delete a VM:**

```
DELETE /vm/{name}
```

Used when a student finishes or when a VM is damaged by malicious code:

```java
IMachine machine = vbox.findMachine(name);
List<IMedium> media = machine.unregister(
    CleanupMode.DetachAllReturnHardDisksOnly
);
IProgress progress = machine.deleteConfig(media);
progress.waitForCompletion(60000);
```

### Code Execution

**Copy source file into VM:**

```
POST /vm/{name}/copyfile
Body: XML with source code details
```

Uses SSH to transfer a file into the running VM:

```java
JSch jsch = new JSch();
Session sshSession = jsch.getSession(
    "user", vmIpAddress, 22
);
sshSession.connect();
ChannelSftp channel = (ChannelSftp) sshSession.openChannel("sftp");
channel.connect();
channel.put(localFilePath, "/vm-tools/input/program.xml");
```

**Compile source code:**

```
POST /program/compile
Body: { "vmName": "student-42" }
```

SSHs into the VM and invokes the utility JAR:

```java
ChannelExec exec = (ChannelExec) sshSession.openChannel("exec");
exec.setCommand("java -jar /vm-tools/utility.jar compile");
exec.connect();
// read output stream for compilation results
```

**Execute compiled code:**

```
POST /program/execute
Body: { "vmName": "student-42" }
```

Same pattern — SSH into VM, run utility with `execute` flag, capture stdout/stderr.

## Request and Response Format

All requests and responses use XML. The source code transfer format:

```xml
<programDetails>
  <className>BubbleSort</className>
  <sourceCode>
    public class BubbleSort {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int[] arr = {5, 3, 1, 4, 2};
            // student solution here
        }
    }
  </sourceCode>
  <action>COMPILE</action>
</programDetails>
```

Compilation result:

```xml
<compilationResult>
  <status>SUCCESS</status>
  <errors/>
</compilationResult>
```

Or on failure:

```xml
<compilationResult>
  <status>FAILURE</status>
  <errors>
    <error>
      <line>7</line>
      <column>12</column>
      <message>';' expected</message>
    </error>
  </errors>
</compilationResult>
```

## Implementation Stack

The REST API is a standard Java web application:

- **JAX-RS / Jersey** for REST endpoints
- **VirtualBox SDK** (`vboxjws.jar`) for VM control
- **JSch** for SSH file transfer and remote command execution
- **JAXB** for XML marshalling/unmarshalling
- **Tomcat** as the application server

The war file deploys on any Tomcat instance. The VirtualBox instance can be on the same machine or a different server on the same network — the SDK connects via the `vboxwebsrv` URL.

## What This Enabled

Once the REST API was running, the Moodle plugin could control the entire VM lifecycle through simple HTTP calls:

1. `POST /vm/clone` — provision a VM for this student
2. `POST /vm/{name}/start` — boot it
3. `POST /vm/{name}/copyfile` — send the student's code
4. `POST /program/compile` — compile it
5. `POST /program/execute` — run it
6. Parse the XML result, assign a grade in Moodle
7. `POST /vm/{name}/stop` — shut it down

The Moodle plugin is completely decoupled from VirtualBox. It just makes HTTP calls and handles XML responses. This is the same abstraction pattern that AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure use for their compute APIs — a clean HTTP contract between the consumer and the infrastructure.

## What Would Change Today

The same REST API pattern holds. What changes is the underlying implementation:

- `vboxjws.jar` → Docker Java SDK (`docker-java`)
- `vboxwebsrv` → Docker Engine API (already HTTP-native)
- SSH file transfer → Docker `CopyArchiveToContainerCmd`
- VM clone → Docker container from image
- XML format → JSON

The endpoint contract — clone, start, stop, execute, delete — maps directly to Docker container operations. Layer 4 (the Moodle plugin) would not change at all.
